<!-- ATTENTION:

    Any feature request that relates to the overall function of the site,
    its policies, specific communities, etc. should be vetted on the main
    meta site *first*. Once discussion has happened there and there is a
    clear consensus on how the feature should work, then it can be proposed
    here (with a link to the discussion) as a way to track development progress.
    Site UX or policy feature requests without links to existing meta
    discussions may be closed. More technical feature requests that don't
    impact site polity are fine here.

    For more discussion of what issues should go here, see:
