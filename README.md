# TopAnswers â€” [https://topanswers.xyz][ta]

*A lasting library of knowledge for the internet.*

[TopAnswers][ta] is what Stack Overflow should be: focused on communities and knowledge sharing, not profit. We share some of the same aims:

-   Focus on questions and answers. Everything else we do is to *help* us produce useful questions and answers.
-   Keep the signal:noise ratio high with a voting system that helps good answers float to the top.
-   Build communities of experts across a diverse range of subjects.

We aren't a clone though; we diverge in important areas:

-   We are not for-profit, so contributors will never be the 'product', and our core aims will not evolve over time.
-   As much as possible of our platform is published [as open source](https://topanswers.xyz/meta?q=28) [on GitHub](https://topanswers.xyz/meta?q=221#a580).
-   We've improved the focus on Q&A by moving comments to the side.
-   You are [free to decide how to license your contributions](https://topanswers.xyz/meta?q=18#a8).

We are small right now --- we already launched [Databases](https://topanswers.xyz/databases), [TeX](https://topanswers.xyz/tex) and [Code Golf](https://topanswers.xyz/codegolf) and also have a \*nix community in private beta.
If you would like to help build a community here, [you can](https://topanswers.xyz/meta?q=211). If you are coming from an existing Stack Exchange community you will be able to [import your content](https://topanswers.xyz/meta?q=236#a176) from there.

There is a lot more detailed information on our [Meta](https://topanswers.xyz/meta) community (a place for questions and answers about TopAnswers itself), for example:

-   [Why we are building TopAnswers](https://topanswers.xyz/meta?q=1)
-   [TopAnswers Code of Conduct](https://topanswers.xyz/meta?q=8)
-   [Who will moderate and what tools will they have access to?](https://topanswers.xyz/meta?q=182)
-   [What markdown options are available?](https://topanswers.xyz/meta?q=72)

Finally, we share many goals (and some contributors) with another project you might like to know about: [Codidact](https://codidact.org/).
